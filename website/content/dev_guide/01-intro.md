## Nem Presentation

Nem is a blockchain built from scratch, learning some lessons from Bitcoin.
If you need an introduction to the blockchain concept, here is a [good visual introduction](https://anders.com/blockchain/),
 which also propose an interactive part.

Nem is providing:

* editable n-of-m multi-sig: an action in a Nem account is authorized only if n of m key identified as authorised validate it. 
  When you create your account, it is a 1-of-1 account, meaning only you need to validate any operation. It is however possible
  to modify the account to add authorised keys, and specify how many of them need to validate an operation. This can be 1-of-2,
  or 2-of-5, and can evolve over time.
* mosaic, an implementation of asset also known as colored coins.
* namespaces.
* a [client](https://www.nem.io/install.html) (on the desktop: previously NCC, currently NanoWallet; or mobile) - server (NIS, the next version of it being named Catapult) approach, easing the development of solutions on Nem as your software only has to talk to a NIS instance.
* software backed by a test suite
* Proof of Importance
* a peers reputation system
* a one minute average block time
* delegated harvesting: no need to let your own computer connected to compute blocks and reap fees, you can delegate your importance to 
  a NIS instance of your choice without risk of loosing your funds
* a currency named XEM, used to pay for fees of operations on the blockchain

These can be leveraged to build products and tools, such as [Apostille](https://blog.nem.io/apostille/), a notarisation service; or  [Landstead](http://landstead.atraurablockchain.com/#!/), a land and property registry. The NEM features enable you to rapidly deliver working products

## Integrating with Nem

At time of writing in April 2017, the Catapult rewrite of NIS is well underway. It is said to provide a mostly compatible REST API with NIS, the 
server currently available. We will thus base this guide on the REST API. That API can be accessed from any language.

## Testing net

Before you run your code on the Nem blockchain, you might want to validate it in a test environment, without having to spend real XEMS
to pay the fees of your operations. That's the purpose of the test net, a version of the Nem blockchain used for testing not only your
applications, but also newer versions of the Nem software itself.

If you run a NIS instance yourself, you can configure it with the key `nem.network`. For you NIS to join the production Nem blockchain, 
set its value to `mainnet`, and for it to use the test blockchain, set its value to `testnet`. `mainnet` and `testnet`  is also the way we will identify 
in this document the two environments. 

If you don't run your own NIS instance, but still want to work in the testnet, you can find a list of NIS instance part of the testnet at
[http://bob.nem.ninja:8765/#/nodes/](http://bob.nem.ninja:8765/#/nodes/).

## Docker config

A docker config has been implemented to accompany this dev guide. It is located in the `docker/` subdirectory of this very repository.
It is a docker image based on Ubuntu 16.04, the latest long term support release available.
When you run the container, it start a NIS node on the testnet.

NIS is started by [supervisord](http://www.supervisord.org). The NIS data is stored under /var/lib/nem, and the logs are available at 
`/var/log/nis-stderr.log` and `/var/log/nis-stdout.log`.

### Using the docker config
To build the Docker image, go in the subdirectory and issue the build command:
```
cd docker/
docker build -t testdev .
```
You can now run a container based on the image. The best and advised solution is to create a directory on your host in which the 
data of NIS will be persistently stored. That way you can create a new container without having to redownload the whole NEM blockchain
(eg in case of upgrades of NIS). In our example we will store the data in `/data/nis-data`, but you can choose another location as long
as you pass it as an absolute path (ie the path must start with `/`).
```
persistent_location="/data/nis-data"
[[ -d $persistent_location ]] || mkdir $persistent_location
docker run -it --rm -v $persistent_location:/var/lib/nem -p 7890:7890 testdev bash
```

This will drop you in a shell from which you can replicate the commands in this dev guide. The NIS is listening on localhost port 7890.
If you want to make NIS available from your host, you just have to pass this additional flags: `-p 7890:7890`.

### Customising the docker config
You can of course customise the docker image built. Just remember that the Dockerfile of this guide might also evolve. If you want to 
follow the changes of it, you might have to merge your changes. Strategies to do that might be to use `git stash` or a dedicated git branch
which you rebase. Explaining this is out of scope of this guide though.
